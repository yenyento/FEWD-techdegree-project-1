        <h2>Overseas</h2>
        <p>In Vietnam, I served as a director at Delphi Industry Co. Ltd. (Ho Chi Minh City), for the Quality Control and Production Management departments.</p>

        <p>As one of the company's first employees&mdash;now numbering in the thousands&mdash;I was also heavily involved with the computer network, which I helped maintain, supervising all work that was done in that regard.</p>
        <p>We started out using MS DOS, which now seems like ancient history. I am grateful to Delphi, for the wonderful opportunity that it gave me for professional development, as well as the many friendships I developed during those years.</p>

        <h2>U.S.</h2>
        <p>During my first 15 years in the United States, I worked as office manager at Pacific Century Realty, in Silicon Valley, California.</p>

        <p>I actually did some low-level coding, as my responsibilities included posting regularly to sites like Craig's List, where the ads called for use of some very basic HTML. I also helped supervise developers (hired primarily through Elance/Upwork) who created websites for us over the years.</p>
        <p>Though my knowledge of HTML was very basic, it was nonetheless a helpful foundation for my studies at Treehouse, toward the Front-End Web Development Techdegree.</p>
